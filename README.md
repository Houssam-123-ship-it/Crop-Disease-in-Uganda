# 🌿 Crop Disease Classification in Uganda — WQU Work Simulation

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is part of the **WorldQuant University (WQU) Data Science Work Simulation** and is inspired by real-world challenges in **agriculture and computer vision**.

The goal is to build a **deep learning model** that classifies images of **cassava plants in Uganda** into **five categories** — identifying whether a crop is healthy or affected by a specific disease.

Throughout the project, I worked with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency while preventing model overfitting.

### ⚙️ Part 3 — Transfer Learning & Callbacks

* Load and preprocess cassava plant images for training.
* Use **Transfer Learning** by adapting a **pre-trained image classification model** (e.g., ResNet or MobileNet).
* Apply **Callbacks** to enhance model optimization:

  * **Learning Rate Scheduling** — dynamically adjust learning rate during training.
  * **Model Checkpointing** — save the best-performing model automatically.
  * **Early Stopping** — stop training when validation accuracy stops improving.
* Evaluate model performance using **k-fold cross-validation** for robustness.
* Generate predictions and prepare a formatted **competition submission file**.

**New Terms:**
`Transfer Learning`, `Callbacks`, `Learning Rate Scheduling`, `Checkpointing`, `Early Stopping`

## 💡 Quick Tip — Efficient Training

Training CNNs on large image datasets is computationally demanding.
To save time, I leveraged a **pre-trained model** and implemented **callbacks** such as **EarlyStopping**, **ModelCheckpoint**, and **LearningRateScheduler**.

This approach allowed me to **reduce training time**, avoid **overfitting**, and maintain **high accuracy** — an essential practice in real-world ML workflows.

## 🌍 Ethical & Sustainability Perspective — *Data Pollution & Power (2022)*

The following excerpt comes from [**Data Pollution & Power (2022)**](https://gryhasselbalch.com/books/data-pollution-power-a-white-paper-for-a-global-sustainable-development-agenda-on-ai/), a white paper published by the **Bonn Sustainable AI Lab, Institute for Science and Ethics, University of Bonn**.

> “Data pollution” refers to the **adverse environmental and societal impact** caused by generating, storing, handling, and processing digital data. It highlights the environmental costs of AI and Big Data, the unequal distribution of these costs across the Global North and South, and the **power dynamics** between governments, corporations, and individuals in managing data resources.
>
> The report emphasizes the need for a **holistic global approach** to AI sustainability — balancing technological advancement with ecological responsibility and social equity.

This project aligns with those principles by promoting **efficient AI practices**, such as:

* Using **Transfer Learning** instead of training from scratch to reduce computational waste.
* Employing **Early Stopping** to minimize unnecessary energy use during training.
* Raising awareness of the **ethical implications** of large-scale AI model deployment.
